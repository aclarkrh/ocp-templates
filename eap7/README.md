# Template components for converting EAP 7 applications to deploy to OpenShift Container Platform

## Overview
These template components allow you to convert an ordinary Java application to an application that is ready to be deployed to OpenShift Container Platform.

The application must already be deployable to JBoss EAP 7 before adding these components. Applications currently running on another application server should be converted to JBoss EAP 7 before apploying these template components.

The following guides are available with further information:
